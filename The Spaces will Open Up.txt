I love playing soccer, and by all measures, I consider myself a great player. My touch is sharp, my shot is powerful, and my vision and dribbling allow me to weave through defenses, finding the best paths to attack. Yet, for years, something held me back—I played with fear. Fear of losing the ball. Fear of getting hurt. Against physical players, that fear magnified; I hesitated, shied away from contact, and never reached my full potential. I’m not even sure where it came from, but I knew it was there.

When I arrived at UT, I found myself on the IM fields at Whitaker, where the standard was higher than anywhere I had ever played. Every player was good—strong, fast, physical. I joined an IM team, played in charity tournaments, competed in Showdown. But still, I couldn’t break through my mental block. My technical ability remained the same, but my performance did not. Determined to overcome it, I worked at it relentlessly. And lately, my improvement hasn’t been gradual—it’s been exponential.

Three weeks ago, my IM team, Hawk Tchouaméni, played Blue Balls FC in an 8v8 practice match. I had already begun improving, but this was my first game on the IM fields since winter break, and I felt the nerves creeping back. I spent the entire day hyping up the game, mentally preparing, visualizing every moment, hoping I could pull off something special. The adrenaline built up, and I tried to channel it. But once the game started, everything felt off. The spaces were too tight, the players moved too fast, and I felt too slow. Blue Balls FC had size, strength, and skill—some of their players were grad students, and all of them had quality. Every time I got the ball, it felt like the world was collapsing around me, defenders swarming too quickly, cutting off every option before I could react. It was suffocating. I was in awe of professional players who could operate in such tight spaces, seemingly unaffected. We lost 4-0.

Three weeks later, we played them again. Same field, same 8v8 setup, same players. But something had changed. I stepped onto the pitch, not burdened by overthinking, not weighed down by self-doubt. I didn’t spend a second visualizing the game—I just warmed up as usual, more confident, more comfortable. And suddenly, **the spaces opened up**.

The same defenders who had swarmed me before didn’t seem as quick. The time I once lacked on the ball now felt abundant. The field hadn’t grown, but in my head, it had expanded. I found gaps I couldn’t see before, turned into challenges I used to avoid, and played my best game yet. The same scenarios that once guaranteed I’d lose the ball became moments of creativity—dribbles, key passes, shots that should have gone in. I got an assist. We won 5-4. But more than the score, what mattered was how different everything felt. I wasn’t scared anymore.

The same thing happens in AI.

Undergraduate research can feel like stepping onto a field where everyone is stronger, faster, and years ahead. You see the big labs—OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Brain—moving at breakneck speed, announcing breakthroughs that shake the field before you’ve even wrapped your head around the last one. You open X (formerly Twitter), see someone your age publishing a NeurIPS paper, someone else interning at Anthropic, another building a startup using a model they fine-tuned. It’s easy to feel like the spaces are too tight, that the best paths are already taken, that there’s no room to maneuver.

But here’s the thing: **the spaces will open up.**

At first, everything feels fast and overwhelming. But the more you play, the more the game slows down. The AI research landscape isn’t a fixed field—it’s fluid, shifting, constantly evolving. The people you idolize today were once in the same position, watching from the sidelines, wondering if they could ever reach that level. The difference is, they kept playing. They didn’t spend all their time visualizing success; they just played the game.

That’s how I approach AI. I don’t try to keep up with everything, because that’s impossible. I focus on improving my game, moving one step at a time. I build, I experiment, I refine my understanding. Right now, I’m researching with Dr. Peter Stone, working on robot soccer—the perfect intersection of my two passions. Through this, I’m learning how AI decision-making works in dynamic, fast-moving environments. Instead of chasing flashy results, I’m focusing on fundamentals: reinforcement learning, multi-agent coordination, and real-time adaptation. Because just like in soccer, the players who dominate aren’t always the ones who move the fastest—they’re the ones who see the field differently.

Concepts that once seemed impossible to grasp become second nature. The research pace doesn’t slow down, but my ability to navigate it speeds up. 

If you’re an undergrad in AI, don’t let fear keep you from playing your best game. Don’t let the pace of the field make you think you’re too slow. Keep moving. Keep thinking. Keep building. And one day, the spaces will open up for you, too.
