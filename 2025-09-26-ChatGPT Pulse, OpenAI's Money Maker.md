# ChatGPT Pulse and the Future of AI Media

For as long as technology has shaped the way we live, the real breakthroughs in business have not been about the technology itself, but about how to turn it into a sustainable model. Search engines were amazing from the start, but Google only became a money machine when ads were introduced alongside search results. Facebook was a powerful way to connect with people, but its true revenue engine came from ads. YouTube found the same path. The product mattered, but the business model defined the scale.

This has been on my mind for years. When I started Inkwell, my idea was that books could be free if supported by ads. Authors would earn more, readers would pay nothing, and the ecosystem would thrive. The insight was simple: the product itself is important, but the business model is what unlocks its potential.

AI has been going through this since the release of ChatGPT. What feels different about this is that the cost of deploying and running large models is massive, and a basic subscription model will never be enough to cover the scale. There was a greater sense of urgency to find a sustainable model beyond API calls and subscriptions. Ads were always on the table. For a while, people experimented with ads embedded directly into AI responses. Perplexity tried it. It felt off. The responses lost their authenticity, and the experiment quickly faded.

But here’s the reality: the amount of time people spend inside AI products is exploding. If the industry can find a way to layer ads into that experience without breaking trust, there is more money to be made here than anywhere else in tech.

That is one of the reasons why ChatGPT Pulse is so exciting to me.

## From Jarvis to Pulse

One of my dreams has always been to have a real AI assistant. I think back to the scenes in Iron Man when Tony Stark wakes up Jarvis and gets a briefing of the day, his schedule, and the things he needs to know. That’s what I always wanted ChatGPT to be.

When OpenAI released scheduled tasks, they showed small use cases like setting reminders or summarizing emails. But I built my own “morning newspaper.” Every day I would wake up to a personalized update on news, sports, and AI research papers. It was clunky, but it worked, and it felt like a glimpse of the future.

Pulse is a better version of that vision. It creates daily, personalized briefings delivered in clean visual cards. It integrates memory, context, and even apps like your calendar and email if you choose to connect them. Instead of asking ChatGPT to summarize what’s happening, you wake up and it’s already there. It’s proactive. It feels like the first real step toward the personal AI assistant we have all been waiting for.

## Why Pulse Might Become the Business Model

Pulse is not just a feature. It is the start of something bigger: AI media.

Think about it. Every morning you open Pulse and see updates on your email, the weather, AI papers you follow, stock prices, or even a piece of AI-generated art. It becomes a daily habit, like reading a newspaper. And like newspapers, the model for making money is obvious: ads.

Done wrong, ads ruin the experience. Done right, they enhance it. Imagine seeing a personalized ad in your Pulse briefing the same way you see a full-page ad in a Sunday paper. It feels natural. It does not break the flow. In fact, if it is well targeted, it could feel helpful.

This is why I think Pulse could be OpenAI’s real moneymaker. It will not be robotics. It will not just be subscriptions. It will be this app. The difference is that these ads will feel different. They will be personalized, useful, and balanced against genuine content. I trust that the culture at OpenAI, with its emphasis on alignment and responsibility, will find that balance.

Think about newspapers. They had articles, they had games, they had ads. What they were missing was personalization. I think Pulse should be just that. A newspaper. Personalized to cover your needs and agendas. It has access to your past chats, your goals and interests, your emails and calendars, and takes that all in to create the perfect morning briefing, or the best nighttime wind-down read.

The contrast with Meta’s recent **Vibes** launch makes this even clearer. Vibes is a feed of short AI-generated videos, designed to be remixed, shared, and consumed endlessly. It is closer to algorithmic churn than clarity. Brainrot in its final, ugly form.

Pulse, on the other hand, points in the opposite direction. Where Vibes leans into entertainment and distraction, Pulse leans into productivity and personalization. Vibes is about consuming quickly. Pulse is about curating meaningfully. One is built for scrolling, the other for focus.

That difference matters. Because if AI becomes just another feed of low-quality content, it loses its power. But if AI becomes a personalized newspaper, briefing you on the things that matter most in your life, then it transforms how you start your day.

## The Road Ahead

The levers that make Pulse powerful are clear. Context. Memory. Personalization. For now, it may look like TikTok’s For You page, where users have to guide the algorithm with curation. Over time, as memory deepens, it will just work, blending into daily life as naturally as email or social media feeds.

And once ads are layered in thoughtfully, Pulse will become the revenue model that sustains AI at scale. That is why I see it as more than a convenience feature. It is a glimpse of how AI products will evolve into something that is both indispensable to users and financially sustainable.

## Closing Thoughts

I am genuinely excited about this update. Pulse brings us closer to the world of true personalization that many of us have been imagining for years. It is not social media. It is not AI slop. It is AI media built around productivity, personalization, and utility. After DALL·E 2, GPT-3 and 4, Deep Research, and Codex, this brings back the feeling of possibility. You can feel the AGI.

From a product perspective, I think one flavor of AI that often gets overlooked is not just “what new things can it do?” but “what old things can it do better?” Pulse turning into a newspaper is a great example of this. What else is out there? That question excites me.

For me, this feels like the future. I cannot wait to see it roll out more widely and to see how it grows. It is another step closer to truly personalized AI.
