**Rethinking Deep Learning: The Real Constraints and What Truly Pushes It Forward**

As I've dived deeper into the foundations of deep learning, I've noticed a pattern that has shifted how I understand what truly limits—and drives—the progress of AI systems. Conventional wisdom often points to "scaling laws" as the definitive explanation, but I believe there's more nuance and structure beneath these laws that we haven't fully appreciated.

### The Four Fundamental Constraints

From my perspective, deep learning progress can be clearly understood through four interconnected constraints. Each of these constraints has subcomponents that must scale in harmony:

1. **Model (Architecture & Parameters)**
   - **Architecture**: How models are structured (Transformers, CNNs, etc.)
   - **Parameters**: The size and complexity of the model (number of weights, layers, etc.)
   - **Optimization and Regularization**: Techniques like AdamW, dropout, weight decay, and LoRA.

2. **Data (Quality & Quantity)**
   - **Quantity**: The volume of training data available.
   - **Quality**: Diversity, representativeness, labeling accuracy, and richness of the data.

3. **Compute (Including Efficiency & Energy)**
   - **Compute Quantity**: Raw computational resources available (GPUs, TPUs, etc.)
   - **Compute Efficiency**: Algorithmic improvements that extract more performance per unit of compute (e.g., FlashAttention, optimized kernels).
   - **Energy and Efficiency**: Real-world considerations of energy consumption and the efficiency of resource utilization.

### Why This Framework Matters

When DeepSeek, a recent high-profile AI model, seemingly achieved frontier results with significantly less compute than traditional scaling laws predicted, some argued this disproved conventional scaling wisdom. In my view, DeepSeek didn't contradict scaling laws—it simply emphasized a critical subconstraint: **compute efficiency**. Architectural innovations allowed DeepSeek to accomplish more with less, underscoring why architecture and compute efficiency deserve equal footing in our mental models of AI scaling.


### Toward a Generalized Scaling Law

To clarify my thoughts, I've drafted a conceptual mathematical framework to capture these constraints:

\[ P_{\text{optimal}} \approx k \cdot (M^{\alpha} \cdot D^{\beta} \cdot C^{\gamma}) \]

- \(P_{\text{optimal}}\): Optimal achievable model performance (e.g., accuracy, loss).
- \(M, D, C\): Model, Data, and Compute constraints, respectively.
- \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\): Scaling exponents determining relative impact (yet to be empirically derived).

I haven't empirically tested this yet; right now, this formula represents my intuition—an informed guess built from existing research and thoughtful reflection.

### Moving Forward

Even without empirical testing, I believe there's value in sharing these ideas openly. Clearly defining how we think about constraints helps sharpen our intuition, guide practical experimentation, and better allocate resources.

In the future, I hope to empirically test these ideas, even at small scales, to refine and validate this framework. For now, I see this clearly defined conceptual structure as my guiding map—my way of making sense of a rapidly evolving field.

Deep learning isn't just about raw compute, data, or parameter count—it's about thoughtfully scaling each constraint, recognizing their interdependence, and continually innovating at the intersection of these fundamental factors.
