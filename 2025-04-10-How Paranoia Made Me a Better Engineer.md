When I first joined my first machine learning lab, I was excited and slightly overwhelmed. The lab had secured generous access to compute, paid storage, and external APIs. But behind the generosity was a subtle warning: there were budget issues. Every resource we used — from compute hours to API credits — was something the lab was actively paying for out of pocket, and we were expected to be responsible with it.

At the time, I didn’t fully appreciate what that meant. I wrote data pipelines that "mostly" worked, scripts that "usually" finished without errors, and processes that I trusted would "probably" run correctly overnight. But early on, the consequences were manageable. If a pipeline failed, it wasn’t a big deal — I could simply restart it. It didn’t cost much money, barely lost any data, and at worst, I would lose a few hours of work. For a while, I got away with it. But as I completed more tasks and gained more trust, I was assigned bigger and bigger projects. And as the projects grew, so did the cost of my mistakes.

The real turning point came during a project involving Diffbot, a paid API we used to scrape articles and metadata. I was tasked with pulling millions of articles and processing them. Instead of using the efficient batch API that was designed for large-scale jobs, I mistakenly used the single-request API, sending millions of individual requests. Each request returned a rich payload of metadata, which I was collecting into a single in-memory DataFrame. My plan was to write everything to disk once it finished. It sounds absurd to me now, but at the time, it seemed reasonable — until the virtual machine ran out of memory. The DataFrame crashed, the process failed, and I lost all the collected data. To make matters worse, I had already burned through all of our Diffbot API credits for the month. In one afternoon, a series of small, careless choices — using the wrong API, not chunking the data, not checkpointing to disk — led to a total loss of both the credits and the data we needed.

That mistake hit me hard. It wasn’t just about the lost money or the wasted time. It was the realization that when things fail at scale, they don't fail gracefully — they fail catastrophically. After that incident, I made a decision. I wasn’t going to trust my code, or my instincts, or "probably" ever again. I started building everything with failure in mind. I wrote pipelines that checkpointed every few thousand records. I added intermediate saves. I verified every output, validated every input, and thought constantly about what could go wrong. I became paranoid.

But that paranoia turned out to be one of the most valuable traits I could have developed. Today, that same Diffbot pipeline is robust and reliable. It has since populated our lab’s database with over 200 million entries, automatically scraping, chunking, validating, and saving data every single day. The system that once collapsed under its own weight is now something I’m genuinely proud of — not because it’s flashy or glamorous, but because it’s resilient.

Later, when I moved to another lab to work on training vision transformers for 3D MRI segmentation, I carried that mindset with me. In that lab, the environment was very different. I was given an H100 GPU, nearly unlimited compute credits, and complete freedom to run experiments as I saw fit. No one would have yelled at me if I burned a few thousand dollars of compute — it simply wasn’t something people worried about at that scale. But I didn’t change. I still tracked my loss curves every single day. I made sure every experiment behaved exactly as expected. I double-checked my data pipelines, my training scripts, and my hyperparameters before launching anything long-running. Unlimited resources didn't make me careless; they made me even more careful.

And this is why, in hindsight, I’m grateful for that early failure. In frontier labs today — at places like OpenAI, DeepMind, or Anthropic — the margin for error shrinks as the scale grows. Training a frontier LLM might cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. A missed validation step, a bad config, or a subtle bug isn’t just a technical mistake. It’s an organizational, financial, and scientific disaster. The best engineers I've observed — the ones I look up to — aren’t just brilliant. They’re meticulous. They’re paranoid. They double- and triple-check not because they lack confidence, but because they understand how fragile massive systems really are.

What once felt like an anxious overreaction — triple-checking my code, validating every pipeline, manually monitoring every loss curve — has quietly become one of my greatest strengths. Paranoia taught me not to trust my work blindly. It taught me to respect the real-world costs of failure. It taught me that robustness isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a mindset. And in a world where the stakes only keep getting higher, I wouldn’t have it any other way.
