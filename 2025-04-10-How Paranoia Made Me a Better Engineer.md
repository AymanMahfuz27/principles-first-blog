## How a Costly Mistake and a Dose of Paranoia Made Me a Better Engineer

When I joined my first machine learning lab, I was handed a powerful set of keys: generous access to compute, paid storage, and expensive external APIs. But with those keys came a quiet warning: *be responsible*. The lab was paying for every resource out of pocket, and a casual attitude had real financial consequences.

At first, I didn't fully get it. I wrote data pipelines that "mostly" worked and scripts that I "assumed" would run correctly overnight. For a while, the stakes were low. A failed script meant a few lost hours and a simple restart. I got away with it. But as I took on bigger projects, the cost of "mostly" and "assumed" began to scale exponentially.

The real lesson came when I was tasked with scraping millions of articles using a paid API called Diffbot. In a series of what now seem like comically bad decisions, I used the wrong API endpoint (single-request instead of batch), and I decided to collect all the metadata into a single, massive in-memory DataFrame before writing it to disk. The plan seemed fine, until the virtual machine inevitably ran out of memory. The process crashed, the DataFrame vanished, and I lost all the collected data. To add insult to injury, I had also burned through our entire monthly quota of API credits in a single afternoon. A few careless choices had led to a total loss of both the data and the money we'd spent to get it.

That failure hit me hard. It wasn't just the wasted time or the awkward conversation with my PI. It was the visceral understanding that when things fail at scale, they don't fail gracefully—they fail catastrophically. From that day on, I changed my approach. I stopped trusting my code, my assumptions, or the idea that things would "probably" be fine. I started building everything with failure as a core design principle. I wrote pipelines that checkpointed their progress obsessively. I validated every input and every output. I started thinking like a pessimist to build optimistic systems. I became, in a word, paranoid.

That paranoia has since become the most valuable engineering trait I have. That same Diffbot pipeline, now rebuilt with paranoid resilience, has since populated our lab's database with over 200 million entries, running automatically and reliably day after day. It's not a flashy project, but I'm incredibly proud of it because it *works*. It doesn't break.

When I later moved to a different lab to work on training vision transformers for 3D MRI segmentation, the environment was the polar opposite. I was given an H100 GPU and a virtually unlimited budget for compute. No one would have blinked if I'd burned a few thousand dollars on a failed experiment. But the paranoia stayed with me. I still tracked my loss curves daily. I still double- and triple-checked my data pipelines and configs before launching a long run. The unlimited resources didn't make me careless; they made me more disciplined, because I now understood the true cost of a mistake, even if it wasn't measured in my own lab's dollars.

This is why I'm grateful for that early, painful failure. At the frontier of AI, at places like OpenAI, DeepMind, or Anthropic, the stakes are astronomical. Training a new foundation model can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. A subtle bug in a data pipeline or a misconfigured training run isn't just a technical error; it's a multi-million dollar disaster. The best engineers I've had the chance to observe, the ones I truly look up to, aren't just brilliant; they are meticulously, relentlessly paranoid. They check and re-check, not because they lack confidence, but because they have a profound respect for the fragility of complex systems at scale.

What started as an anxious reaction to a mistake has become the bedrock of my engineering philosophy. Paranoia taught me to build for resilience, to respect the cost of failure, and to never again assume that things will "probably" be fine. In a world where the stakes of our work are only getting higher, it’s a mindset I wouldn’t trade for anything.
