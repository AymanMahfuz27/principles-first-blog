## From Physics to Math: The Grand Unification of My AI Intuition

For the last few months, I've been on a mission to build a real intuition for how large language models work. I've written about the idea that prediction forces compression, and how that compression could be the engine of emergent intelligence. I even ran a small experiment to test that theory. It felt like I was getting closer to a real understanding, piecing together a puzzle.

Then, a few days ago, I heard two words that made the entire puzzle snap into place: **Solomonoff Induction.**

I was listening to a talk where an OpenAI researcher was asked why unsupervised learning is so effective. He answered with a single word: "Compression." Then he explained that, in a perfect world, the ultimate form of intelligence is Solomonoff Inductionâ€”the idea that the best way to predict the future is to find the simplest program that can explain all your past observations. It's a formalization of Occam's Razor, a beautiful blend of Bayesian reasoning and computational theory.

Hearing that didn't just add a new piece to my puzzle; it revealed a new layer beneath the entire thing. It re-contextualized my whole journey of understanding.

### The Journey So Far: From Programming to Physics

For a long time, I thought about machine learning like **programming**. It was an empirical craft of trial and error, of engineering features and tweaking architectures.

Then, as I wrote about recently, it started to feel more like **physics**. The discovery of scaling laws revealed a surprising order beneath the chaos. The messy, unpredictable process of training a neural network was governed by elegant, predictable power laws. It felt like we were uncovering the fundamental laws of a new kind of nature.

But Solomonoff Induction and the principle of compression revealed a deeper layer still. Beneath the physics, there is **mathematics**. Not the mathematics of statistics and curve-fitting, but the deep, foundational mathematics of complexity, computation, and information theory. The goal of a deep learning model, in this view, is not just to match patterns in data. It's to find the **shortest possible program** that explains the data.

This doesn't invalidate the previous layers; it unifies them. The physics-like scaling laws emerge *because* the model is trying to find the most efficient compression. The engineering breakthroughs are just better ways to facilitate that search. It all comes down to compression.

### The Great Debate: Should We Engineer Structure or Just Scale?

This new lens also brings one of the biggest debates in AI into sharp focus: should we be manually engineering structure into our models, or should we just trust in the power of scale?

History has a clear pattern here.

*   **Arithmetic:** Early models like GPT-2 couldn't do simple math, so researchers experimented with building in explicit arithmetic modules. Then came GPT-3, a model so large that it learned to do basic math on its own, simply by compressing the patterns in its vast dataset. **Scale won.**
*   **Chess:** For decades, the best chess engines were built on hand-crafted value functions, where humans painstakingly defined what mattered. Then came AlphaZero, a deep neural network that was just given the rules and told to play against itself. It discovered strategies far beyond what any human had ever conceived. **Scale won.**
*   **Computer Vision:** The field was once dominated by hand-designed feature extractors like SIFT and HOG. Then came AlexNet, a relatively simple convolutional network scaled up on a huge dataset. It learned its own features that blew everything else out of the water. **Scale won.**

Time and time again, we've seen that neural networks, when given enough data and enough pressure to compress that data, are the ultimate feature extractors. They discover structures that are more powerful and nuanced than anything we could have designed by hand.

This leads to a powerful, and somewhat humbling, conclusion that seems to be the guiding philosophy at places like OpenAI: **Scale is the ultimate prior.** Don't hard-code structure unless you absolutely have to. Let the model find its own way, because its way is probably better.

### The Final Layer of Understanding

Of course, the story isn't over. Maybe high-level reasoning is different. Maybe it's a type of structure so brittle and complex that it can't be compressed smoothly from data alone. I don't know the answer to that, and the uncertainty is part of the excitement.

But what I do know is that my own mental model has been compressed. The journey from seeing AI as programming, then as physics, and now as a form of applied computational mathematics feels like a journey toward a first principle.

When I started this blog, I wrote about deconstructing things to find their foundations. It seems I've been accidentally doing that to my own understanding. And right now, the foundation looks a lot like this: the universe is full of structure, and intelligence is the process of finding the most elegant, compressed representation of that structure. The future of AI might just be about finding the shortest programs that explain everything.
