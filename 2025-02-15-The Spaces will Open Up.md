## The Field Shrinks, Then It Expands: How Soccer Taught Me to Navigate the Pace of AI

I’ve always loved soccer. By any measure, I’m a decent player—good touch, a powerful shot, and the vision to see a play developing. But for years, I was held back by a single, crippling thought: the fear of losing the ball. It was a mental block that would shrink the field around me. Against bigger, more physical players, that fear intensified. I’d hesitate, shy away from a 50/50 challenge, and pull back when I should have pushed forward. I was playing with the brakes on.

When I came to UT, I found myself on the IM fields at Whitaker, where the level of play was a serious step up. Everyone was fast, strong, and technical. I joined a team, played in tournaments, and competed in the annual Showdown, but I couldn’t shake that mental hurdle. My skills were there, but my performance wasn’t. It was a puzzle I was determined to solve. And recently, the solution didn’t come gradually—it came like a floodgate opening.

Three weeks ago, my IM team, Hawk Tchouaméni, had a friendly against a team called Blue Balls FC. I’d been working on my mindset, but this was the first real test back on the IM fields after winter break, and the old nerves started to creep in. I spent the day hyping myself up, visualizing plays, trying to force confidence. But when the whistle blew, it all fell apart. The field felt claustrophobic. Players moved in a blur. Blue Balls FC was stacked with older, stronger grad students, and they were good. Every time I got the ball, a defender was instantly on me, closing down every angle before I could even think. It was suffocating. We lost 4-0.

Fast forward three weeks. Same teams, same field, same 8v8 setup. But this time, something was different. I stepped onto the pitch without the weight of expectation. I didn't spend hours visualizing—I just warmed up, trusted my instincts, and played. And then, it happened: **the spaces opened up.**

The same defenders who had seemed impossibly fast now felt a step behind. The pocket of time I had on the ball, which used to be fractions of a second, now felt like an eternity. The field hadn't physically changed, but in my mind, it had doubled in size. I was seeing passing lanes that were invisible before. I was taking on players I would have shied away from. I played my best game yet, not because my skills had dramatically improved in three weeks, but because my perception of the game had fundamentally shifted. We won 5-4. The fear was gone, and the field had opened up.

This is exactly what it feels like to be an undergraduate researcher in AI.

You step onto a field where the players seem like giants. You see the big labs—OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic—pushing out breakthroughs at a dizzying pace. You scroll through X and see people your age publishing at NeurIPS, landing dream internships, or building startups on the latest models. It's incredibly easy to feel like the field is shrinking, that all the interesting problems are already being solved by people who are smarter and faster than you.

But here’s the secret: **the spaces will open up.**

At first, the world of AI research feels like that chaotic, suffocating game. The pace is relentless, the concepts are dense, and it feels like you're constantly playing catch-up. But the more you engage—the more papers you read, the more code you write, the more ideas you test—the more the game slows down. The AI landscape isn't a fixed set of problems; it's a dynamic, ever-expanding field. The researchers you look up to today were once standing where you are now, feeling just as overwhelmed. The difference is, they kept playing.

This is the mindset I bring to my own work in AI. I can't possibly keep up with every new paper or model. Instead, I focus on what I can control: my own learning, my own projects, and my own curiosity. Right now, I’m working with Dr. Peter Stone on robot soccer—a perfect marriage of my two passions. It’s forcing me to get my hands dirty with the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and real-time decision-making. I'm not just chasing the latest hype; I'm building a foundational understanding of how intelligent agents operate in complex, dynamic environments.

And just like on the soccer field, the concepts that once felt impossible are starting to become second nature. The pace of research hasn't slowed down, but my ability to navigate it has. The field is starting to open up.

So if you’re an undergrad in AI feeling overwhelmed, my advice is this: stop watching from the sidelines. Stop letting the fear of not being good enough keep you from playing. Get on the field. Build something. Break something. Ask dumb questions. And trust that, with time, the spaces will open up for you, too.
