# **Towards Tiki-Taka: The Power of Active Waiting in Multi-Agent AI**

## **The Problem with AI’s Instant Reflexes**

Modern AI reacts too quickly. Whether in reinforcement learning, robotics, or large-scale multi-agent systems, AI’s default mode of operation is immediate action—observe the environment, compute an optimal move, execute, repeat. But real intelligence isn’t just about action. It’s about choosing when to act and, more importantly, when to wait.

In human decision-making, waiting is a strategic tool. The best players—whether in sports, business, negotiation, or warfare—don’t just react; they delay, anticipate, and manipulate time to force their opponents into suboptimal decisions. Yet AI systems today lack this capacity. They operate under the assumption that faster decisions are inherently better, ignoring the vast strategic potential of well-timed inaction. This raises a fundamental question: what if AI could learn to wait?

## **The Evolution of Multi-Agent Learning: From Reaction to Strategy**

My research interest began with an ostensibly simple problem: how do we get AI to play soccer intelligently? The conventional approach involved hand-engineering reward functions to incentivize desirable behaviors—rewarding passes, penalizing selfish play, encouraging strategic positioning. However, I quickly realized that reward engineering alone was insufficient. The AI optimized selfishly, prioritizing immediate payoffs over long-term strategy. Agents would shoot from poor positions if the expected reward for a goal was higher than passing, even when a pass would lead to a much higher probability of scoring a few moments later. There was no notion of patience, no recognition that sometimes, the best move is no move at all. This realization led me to reconsider how AI handles time.

## **The Breakthrough: Teaching AI to Actively Wait**

In human competition, waiting is often the decisive factor between victory and defeat. The greatest athletes and strategists manipulate time in ways that force their opponents into errors. A chess grandmaster delays a move to induce impatience, a poker player holds their bet to pressure competitors, and a skilled negotiator remains silent to draw concessions from the other side. Yet AI, as it stands, operates on a rigid decision cycle, where actions are taken as soon as possible. What if we allowed AI to delay its decisions strategically?

The concept of active waiting presents an alternative paradigm: rather than forcing agents to act immediately, they should have the ability to pause, observe, and reevaluate before making a move. This alone could transform multi-agent behavior. A passing lane that appears closed may open a second later. A defender might lunge if given the illusion of opportunity. In a negotiation, an adversary may reveal their intentions if forced to fill the silence. Strategic waiting is a profound but underexplored dimension of decision-making in AI.

## **Scaling Waiting into Large-Scale Multi-Agent AI**

The implications of active waiting extend beyond robot soccer. The broader field of multi-agent AI could fundamentally change if we reframe decision-making around not just what to do, but when to do it. 

In business and negotiation, a financial AI trained with active waiting could delay executing trades to manipulate market conditions. In cybersecurity, rather than reacting instantly to threats, an AI defender could observe attack patterns, waiting for an adversary to commit before deploying countermeasures. In human-AI collaboration, waiting could improve conversational agents—an AI personal assistant that interrupts at the wrong moment is frustrating, but one that interjects at precisely the right time becomes invaluable.

## **The Future: How to Train AI That Understands Time**

If waiting is so crucial, why isn’t AI already using it? The answer lies in how we train reinforcement learning models. Conventional reinforcement learning optimizes for immediate rewards, which discourages patience. If an AI can achieve a reward now, there is no reason to delay. The challenge, then, is to design systems that learn the strategic value of waiting. 

One approach could be to modify reward functions to account for temporal patience. Rather than rewarding immediate gains, an AI should receive greater reinforcement for achieving outcomes that depend on delayed actions. Another approach involves predictive modeling—training AI to simulate possible futures before acting. Monte Carlo Tree Search and similar techniques allow AI to project outcomes, but these need to be scaled into multi-agent RL. Finally, inverse reinforcement learning may allow AI to infer waiting strategies from human experts, learning not only what actions to take, but when to take them.

## **Final Thoughts: The Role of Waiting in the Future of AI**

These ideas remain speculative, but that is precisely why they are exciting. This blog is not a presentation of completed research but a roadmap—a set of hypotheses that I intend to explore in the coming months and years. If active waiting proves to be as transformative as I suspect, it will not only change how we train AI for multi-agent collaboration but will also have implications for fields ranging from autonomous systems to economic modeling and beyond. 

The prevailing wisdom in AI today is that faster inference, lower latency, and immediate action are always preferable. But intelligence is not merely about speed; it is about timing. The most advanced AI systems of the future may not be the ones that act the fastest, but the ones that know exactly when to wait.
